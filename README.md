# CodeClauseInternship_Alarm Clock with GUI

## Introduction

In this Python project, we'll explore the utilization of certain Python libraries, specifically Tkinter and datetime. Our primary focus will be on incorporating the current date and time into the project and implementing an alarm feature based on the present date and time.

# Building the GUI Alarm Clock

The procedure for this Python project is divided into several steps.

Step 1: Importing the required modules

Step 2: Creating a function for the alarm

Step 3: Creating the Tkinter window

We will now understand these steps in detail.

Importing the required modules
Before we start building any project, the primary step is to import all the important libraries and modules that we need for the project. In this case, we will need the Tkinter library along with the datetime, time and winsound modules.
1. Tkinter library:This library will allow us to create a window for the user in order to use the application.
2. Datetime and time modules:These modules will allow us to handle dates and times and help us manipulate them whenever required.
3. winsound module:This module will allow us to generate sounds for the alarm clock.
   

Embarking on this Python project with Tkinter and datetime is a fantastic opportunity to learn and create something meaningful. By following the steps outlined, you'll delve into the world of GUI development and time manipulation, gaining valuable experience along the way.
